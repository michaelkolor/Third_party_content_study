# Third_party_content_study
Samples of Extension, Bad Website, and CNN scrape
Hey Radhika!
The files you wanted to look at for floating the divs are in the cnn-11-10-2 folder. 
The selectors for the divs that are highlighted are listed in order in the cnn_test_for_third_party css and js files.
If anything confuses you just shoot me a quick email or text at 724-814-2689
Also ignore the jquery files, I will probably delete most of them but just in case you were thinking of playing around with the 
jquery mobile popup plugin I left them there for now. You will also notice that I commented out the code in the js file that will inject
the form at the top of the page.
